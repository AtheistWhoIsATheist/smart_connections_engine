endurance”) and re-scan to catch more “durability” signals. 3. **Phase engine**: with γ → δ done, we can fuse into Pass ε (Architectonic Consolidation): finalize the Tri-Tier Schema for this corpus, emit updated saturation %, paradox load, and commit the new RMP to JOURNAL314. **MOVE IMMEDIATELY**into **Pass ε and dump** the architectonic consolidation plus a full:EXPORT_METRICS: snapshot,
